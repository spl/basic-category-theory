Basic Category Theory
=====================

This is the source for the book **Basic Category Theory** by Tom Leinster.

Abstract
--------

This short introduction to category theory is for readers with relatively little
mathematical background.  At its heart is the concept of a universal property,
important throughout mathematics.  After a chapter giving the basic definitions,
the three main chapters present three ways of expressing universal properties:
via adjoint functors, representable functors, and limits.  A final chapter ties
the three together.

For each new categorical concept, a generous supply of examples is provided,
taken from different parts of mathematics.  At points where the leap in
abstraction is particularly great (such as the Yoneda lemma), the reader will
find careful and extensive explanations.
